I'll be developing a bot and updating it frequently with more functions and refactoring as I learn more go since i'm still new to the language.

Commands

Help = You are seeing it rn
Ping/Pong = it will simply return ping or pong
TTS = Will send any message after the command with TTS enabled (not very useful indeed)
Join = Will simply join the voice channel of who sent the message
Play = It will play an annoying sound
Leave = leave the VC
Loop = it shouldn't exist, don't use.
LOL = will add a league player to our track DB (usage LOL + player name)
RELOL - will remove a league player from o9ur DB (usage RELOL + player name)
